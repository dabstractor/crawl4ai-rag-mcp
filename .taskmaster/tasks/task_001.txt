# Task ID: 1
# Title: Research FastMCP HTTP Integration Options
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Investigate the best approach for integrating HTTP API capabilities with the existing FastMCP server.
# Details:
Research the three options outlined in the PRD: FastMCP Router Extension, Separate FastAPI Instance, and FastMCP Hook System. Evaluate each approach based on compatibility with current FastMCP version, ease of implementation, and performance impact. Document findings with code examples for each approach. Specifically check if FastMCP exposes the underlying FastAPI app directly or if it has a hook system. Consider using FastAPI 0.104.0+ for its improved typing support and performance. Document any potential breaking changes or compatibility issues with the current MCP implementation.

# Test Strategy:
Create proof-of-concept implementations for each approach and test basic functionality. Measure performance overhead for each approach. Document findings in a comparison matrix with pros/cons for team review.
