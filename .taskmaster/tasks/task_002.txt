# Task ID: 2
# Title: Setup Project Structure for HTTP API Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the necessary directory structure and initial files for the HTTP API implementation.
# Details:
Following the file structure outlined in the PRD, create the following directories and files:
- src/api/__init__.py
- src/api/endpoints.py
- src/api/middleware.py
- src/api/responses.py
- src/utils/http_helpers.py

Ensure proper Python module imports and initialize empty classes/functions that will be implemented in later tasks. Set up proper type hints using Python typing module. Use FastAPI 0.104.0+ for the HTTP layer implementation. Create a requirements.txt file that includes all necessary dependencies including FastAPI, Uvicorn, and any other required packages.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the project structure is correctly set up by running a basic import test that imports all modules. Ensure that the file structure matches the PRD specifications. Run a linting tool (like flake8 or pylint) to verify code structure.
