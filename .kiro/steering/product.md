# Product Overview

## Crawl4AI+SearXNG MCP Server

A self-contained Docker solution that combines Model Context Protocol (MCP), Crawl4AI, SearXNG, and vector databases to provide AI agents and coding assistants with complete web search, crawling, and RAG capabilities.

### Core Value Proposition

Unlike traditional scraping that dumps raw content and overwhelms LLM context windows, this solution uses intelligent RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to:

- Extract only relevant content using semantic similarity search
- Prevent context overflow by returning focused, pertinent information
- Enhance AI responses with precisely targeted knowledge
- Maintain context efficiency for better LLM performance

### Key Features

- **Zero Configuration**: Pre-configured SearXNG instance included
- **Docker-Only**: No Python environment setup required
- **Integrated Search**: Built-in SearXNG for private, fast search
- **Production Ready**: HTTPS, security, and monitoring included
- **AI-Optimized**: RAG strategies built for coding assistants
- **Knowledge Graph**: AI hallucination detection and repository analysis using Neo4j

### Target Users

- AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf)
- Developers building MCP-enabled applications
- Teams needing private web search and content extraction
- Organizations requiring AI hallucination detection for code generation
