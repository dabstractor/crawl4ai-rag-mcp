# Crawl4AI MCP Visualizer UI Project Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing a user interface to visualize crawled websites, embedding descriptions, and other useful information contained within the Crawl4AI MCP system. The UI will connect to the existing Crawl4AI MCP server and provide an intuitive way to explore crawled content.

## API Integration Summary

The UI will integrate with the following Crawl4AI MCP tools:

1. **`get_available_sources`** - Retrieve and display available content sources
2. **`perform_rag_query`** - Power the search functionality
3. **`search_code_examples`** - Enable code example browsing (conditional)
4. **`scrape_urls`** - Allow manual URL scraping from the UI (optional)
5. **`smart_crawl_url`** - Enable intelligent crawling from the UI (optional)

## Database Schema Integration

The UI will work with three main database tables:

1. **`crawled_pages`** - Document content with embeddings
2. **`code_examples`** - Code snippets with summaries (conditional)
3. **`sources`** - Source information and statistics

## Development Tasks Created

The following development tasks have been created and tracked using Task Master AI:

1. **Set up UI development environment** - Create the basic frontend project structure with chosen framework
2. **Integrate with MCP server** - Set up connection to the Crawl4AI MCP server at http://localhost:8051/sse
3. **Implement dashboard UI components** - Create the main dashboard with statistics display and quick action buttons
4. **Implement document explorer** - Create UI for browsing crawled documents with search and filter capabilities
5. **Implement source management** - Create UI for browsing and managing content sources
6. **Implement semantic search interface** - Create search functionality using the perform_rag_query tool

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining tasks by adding:
   - Code example browser functionality
   - Visualization features
   - Error handling and user feedback
   - Responsive design implementation

2. Implement the frontend framework of choice (React, Vue, or Svelte)

3. Connect to the MCP server and implement API integrations

4. Test with actual crawled data from the Crawl4AI MCP system

## Technical Requirements

- Modern web framework implementation
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Secure connection to MCP server
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Containerized deployment option
- Serve on an unusual port (avoiding 8051 which is used by MCP server)

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in time to find specific crawled content
- User satisfaction with search results relevance
- System performance (search response times)
- Adoption rate of visualization features

## Timeline

This is a flexible development plan with the following phases:

**Phase 1 (MVP)**: Basic dashboard, document listing, and search functionality
**Phase 2**: Source management, code example browsing (if enabled), and basic visualizations
**Phase 3**: Advanced features, export functionality, and collaboration features

## Conclusion

The foundation for the Crawl4AI MCP Visualizer UI has been established with clear tasks, API integration plans, and development structure. The next steps involve implementing the frontend framework and connecting to the MCP server APIs.
